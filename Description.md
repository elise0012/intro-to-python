## Lunch / Meals

*We try to find companies to sponsor a meal during our classes if they are over 4 hours long. If we are able to find a sponsor, the meals are usually something affordable for feeding a large group, like pizza. In these instances, we will offer both vegetarian and meat based options. If you have other dietary restrictions such as gluten free, dairy free, vegan, etc., please be sure to bring your own lunch. We will notify attendees a day or two before the class on whether a meal will be provided.*
